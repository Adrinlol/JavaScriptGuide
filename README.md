Front End Project [4/5] - Technical Documentation Page

Technical Documentation Page for my freeCodeCamp front-end project.

### I decided to build this project, in order to help Front-End Developers ace their JavaScript interview questions.

### This includes topics such as: 

- Variables
- Constants
- Scope
- Objects
- Arrays
- Comparison Operators
- Closure

### Using the CSS Grid Layout, I transformed this project into mobile friendly website.

### I tried to gather as much information as I could for the topics that are essential, when it comes to being a JavaScript Developer.
